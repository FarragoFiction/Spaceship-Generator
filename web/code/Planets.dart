/*
planets are gonna be pretty simple.
  -distance from sun
  -size
  -composition
    -rockiness
    -water
    -atmosphere

  *conditions for life:
    -water/atmosphere ratios are close to 1:1, with neither being at 0
    -middle distance from sun
    -average size
    -maybe include some check involving the sun's stats? i havent worked those out yet though

  *add descriptions for what lifeforms are like probably
