-either make the SVG progress bars work in microsoft edge/internet explorer, or replace them with something with better compatibility.
    -they SHOULD be working, the issue seems to be in defining width & height of svg elements.
-revise list of first names.
-add more description bits.
-simplify description/naming process, it's difficult to read right now and is in bad form.
    -make flags so that the details from the description can be used in other parts of the code
end version 1
possible future additions:
-graphical depiction of ship, either the whole thing or a small section.
    -im not sure if this would be practical. first instinct is to make blueprint-esque layouts, but that seems like it would go wrong (even though it would be very cool.)
    
-crew generation
